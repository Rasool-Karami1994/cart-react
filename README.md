# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
An application that simulate parts of an online shopping website shop cart.

Reflection
Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to add products to Shop-cart, Eliminate, increase or decrease the number and calculate the price of products in the cart and finally clear the cart or confirm it.

I used vanilla JS and Css for building this project.
